#This python script is called GamerGuy
#by: Mahmoud Chebbani

#The script uses SQLAlchemy to interact with a MySQL Database
#You will also find attached a copy of the database (gamerguy.sql)
##Steps:
	*Downloaded SQLAlchemy using pip through "pip install sqlalchemy" command and worked with SQLAlchemy 1.1
	*Downloaded pymysql using pip as well
	*Downloaded github and git shell from github.com

##Problems:
	-There were not really problems with the installation and the documentation was clear 

##Descisions:
	-Having learned what SQLAlchemy is and how it works and with what it works, I decided to go with writting
	 OOP python directly without the use of frameworks (example: Flask) and I decided to work with MySQL databse
	 as I had plenty experience working with it before

##Possible Improvments:
	- The script is simple and simulates a real life small example of what could be a bigger project and I think that 
	  with the flexibality of time, GUIs would have been great and the room for creating a fully function system is 
	  is very huge. 
	- The script attached simulates only a small portion of a bigger picture
